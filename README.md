###Punk API
The goal of this project was to create a website that interacted with an API in multiple ways. The project is made in the React framework and uses a punk ipa API for results from the users searches. 

###The App
The App consists of 2 main components, the search box section, and the card list section. This is so props can be passed down to both and allow them to interact with one another.

### The Card List
The card list is created using a mapping over what is fetched from the API, it retrieves the information based on the users search criteria and displays it into a simple, easy to read card.
